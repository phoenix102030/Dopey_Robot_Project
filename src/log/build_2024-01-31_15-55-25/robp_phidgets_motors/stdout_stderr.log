[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:22 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findlibphidget22.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "libphidget22", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "libphidget22" with
  any of the following names:

    libphidget22Config.cmake
    libphidget22-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "libphidget22" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "libphidget22_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "libphidget22" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
